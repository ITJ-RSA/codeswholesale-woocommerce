How to use
----------
1. Download zip file from [here](http://codeswholesale.com/go/woocommerce-zip), install it into your WordPress and activate plugin.
  - WooCommerce plugin is required.
  
2. CodesWholesale tab will apear in admin menu. Under this tab you can configure few things:
 - Environment: sandbox or live, for tests is recommended to use sandbox but if you want to go live choose "live" and put your API credentials.
 - If you'd like to automatically send keys after payment is received e.g. from PayPal mark checkbox with "Automatically complete order when payment is received"
 - Balance value: While purchasing keys from [CodesWholesale.com](http://codeswholesale.com), script will check if your current balance is less than value from this field - if yes, it will send a notification email to shop's administrator.

3. Go to "Add product", put your details and in the "General tab" select [CodesWholesale's](http://codeswholesale.com) product to match. This will tell the script what product is buying your customer.
  - At first step choose "Test with text codes only"

4. Create and order at your front page:
 - Add previously added product to cart.
 - Go through checkout process and put your real email (here you will need PayPal configured to sandbox if you don't want to do that choose bank transfer)
 - When your checkout is finished and if you've marked "Automatically complete order when payment is received" in plugin's configuration you should recive an email with keys, otherwise go to admin panel and mark order as "complete" (you will need to do that with bank transfer too)
 
5. Repeat 3rd and 4th step for all products in Sandbox.
  - Match with "Test with image codes only"
    - In email with keys you should get images in attachment
  - Match with "Test product with high price"
    - You should receive email that something was wrong during script execution 
  - Match with "Test pre order product"
    - You should receive an email about pre ordered codes in CW

6. When all features are well known for you and you agree with them switch environment to "Live" and start selling.

7. Write any feedback to devteam@codeswholesale.com
